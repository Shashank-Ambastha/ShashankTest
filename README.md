Part-A (Theory)
Ans 1: 
The terms "front-end" and "back-end" refer to the two sides of web development. The front-end refers to the client-facing or user-facing side of a website, while the back-end is concerned with the data base, its management and its link with the server. Both the front-end and back-end are needed to form a functional software application or website. It is important that front-end and back-end is well co-ordinated when building a website to create an efficient design.

The front-end development focuses on what users see on the web browser screen. It is a process of transforming the codes created by back-end developers into a graphical interface and ensuring that the data is easy to read and understand. It is the “client-side” of web development.
The back-end development focuses on server-side programming. It involves writing server-side scripts that connect with databases, APIs, and other services to deliver data to the front end.

HTML tags are keywords written inside angular brackets ('<' and '>') which dictate the display and format style of a webpage. Most of the tags require an opening tag('<tag_name>') and a closing tag('</tag_name>'), but not all. Tags help a web browser to distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content.
There are various types of HTML tags:
-Simple text tags(ex: <p></p>, <h1></h1> etc.)
-Unclosed tags(ex: <br> etc.)
-List tags(ex: <ul>, <li> etc.)
-Table tags(ex: <th>, <tr> etc.)
-Style tags(ex: <b>, <i> etc.)

Ans 3: 
Virtual DOM(Document Object Model) is a programming concept where an ideal, or 'virtual', representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the 'real' DOM. This process is called reconciliation.
By this approach we tell React what state we want the UI to be in, VDOM matches that state for us. This basically abstracts out the attribute manipulation, event handling, and manual DOM updating for us.
Since it is more of a pattern than a specific technology, people sometimes say it to mean different things. In React world, the term VDOM is usually associated with React elements since they are the objects representing the user interface.

Key differences between MySQL vs NoSQL are:
-MySQL is a relational database that is based on tabular design and hence also require a detailed database model whereas NoSQL is non-relational in nature with its document-based design.
-MySQL is not so easily scalable due to rigid schema restrictions, whereas NoSQL can be easily scaled with its dynamic schema.
-MySQL is one of the relational database types, whereas NoSQL is more of a design-based database type with examples like MongoDB etc.
-MySQL being a relational database, is less flexible with its design constraint, whereas NoSQL being non-relational, provides a more flexible design than MySQL.
-MySQL uses a standard query language called SQL, whereas NoSQL-like databases miss a standard query language.

Ans 5:
There are three mostly use DBMS technologies SQL, MySQL and NoSQL.
Out of these, NoSQL databases are a new type of database management system that have gained popularity in recent years. Unlike traditional relational databases, NoSQL databases are designed to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, and they can accommodate dynamic changes to the data model1. NoSQL is a type of database management system (DBMS) that is designed to handle and store large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data.
